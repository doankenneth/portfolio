            <h4 class="project-title">The Tower</h4>
            <p>The Tower is a short platforming game consisting of three different levels, each with a unique mechanic. The twist: You don't know what order you get until the game starts. Armed with only a shortsword, you need to pass all three levels, where one hit sends you straight to the beginning of the level. The Tower is one of my earlier games and my first introduction to game development, with everything made by me. From the custom sprites to the core code.</p>

                <h4 class="project-title">One Way Out</h4>
                <p>One Way Out is a Top-Down Horror arcade-style game based on the concept: "What if you couldn't reload?" One Way Out follows a nameless engineer as they attempt to survive an alien attack on their ship with the guns scattered around. The only way to escape is to wipe out enough alien signatures to stop the lock down. One Way Out balances its combat with several objectives that can immediately cause a game over if the player doesn't attend to them. It's a battle against the clock. And there's only one way out.</p>

                <p>This video is a review of Bethesda's 2016 action-adventure stealth game Dishonored 2 made for ENGL 1101 taught by Professor Shane Snyder. In this video, I discuss Dishonored 2's masterfully designed mechanics and how it allows for vast degrees of player agency.</p>
