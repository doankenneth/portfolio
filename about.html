                <p>Ever since I was a kid, video games have always had a special place in my heart. I've been playing video games for as long as I remember and one day I suddenly decided "Hey, what if I did that?"<br><br>
                Since then, I've been learning how to design games, from sprite work, to animation, to coding. I've worked with software like GameMaker Studio and Unity to design my own games.<br><br>
                Along the way, I picked up some video editing skills and now I'm a Game Developer <em>and</em> Video Editor (Quite the combo huh?)
                <br><br>
                My goal is that every time I create something, someone out there will see it and be inspired to get out there and create something themselves, just like how games inspired me so many years ago.</p>

                ...Isn't this right below the "About Me" section? You would've already read-<br><br>
                You know what? Never mind.<br><br>
                I'm Kenneth Doan. I'm from Georgia currently studying Computational Media at the Georgia Institute of Technology, with a focus of Video Games and Media.

            <h4 class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(2)"><span id="answericon2">+</span> Q: What do you do?</h4>
            <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                I'm a Game Developer, first and foremost. From sprite work to coding, from animation to sound design. You name it, I've dabbled in it.
                <br><br>
                But I also know my way around video editing software.

            <h4 class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)"><span id="answericon3">+</span> Q: Where did you learn to design games/edit videos?</h4>
            <div class="answer" id="answer3">
                Uhhhh... YouTube University? I'm mainly self-taught. I learned a long time ago the best way to learn to do something is to try, fail, repeat. So that's what I did. I'm currently studying game design now, but for the most part, everything I do is from years of screwing up and trying again.

            <h4 class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(4)"><span id="answericon4">+</span> Q: What programs do you use?</h4>
            <div class="answer" id="answer4">
                Oh boy, it's quite the list:
                <br><br>
                For game development my primary is GameMaker Studio and Unity, with a little experience in Unreal Engine.
                <br><br>
                For sprite work and sprite animation, Aesprite is my go-to program.
                <br><br>
                And as for video editing: I use DaVinci Resolve.
                <br><br>
                Huh, thought that would be longer.
            </div>
            <h4 class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(5)"><span id="answericon5">+</span> Q: What types of games do you make</h4>
            <div class="answer" id="answer5">
                Well, a little bit of everything. I don't really specialize in one type of game. Instead, I think of something fun to try out. Maybe it's a mechanic from another game I wanted to expand on. Maybe a fusion between a bunch of different idea. I like building games around one fun mechanic and see how to best build around it.
            </div>
            <h4 class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(6)"><span id="answericon6">+</span> Q: Video Editing? Why both? Why not just game development?</h4>
            <div class="answer" id="answer6">
                I love creating things and entertaining people. Whether it be through a thrilling game or a funny video, I love making people laugh and have fun. <br><br>
                If you want to know why <em>specifically</em> video editing, I picked it up as a hobby one day it just stuck around.

            <h4 class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(7)"><span id="answericon7">+</span> Q: What games do you play?</h4>
            <div class="answer" id="answer7">
                Now <em>that's</em> how you get to know me.<br><br>
                I play all sorts of games but I usually stick around the FPS, JRPG, and Stealth genre. Some of my personal favorites are Destiny 2, Persona 5, and Dishonored.
            </div>
            <h4 class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(8)"><span id="answericon8">+</span> Q: Wow, How do you find the time for all this stuff?</h4>
            <div class="answer" id="answer8">
                Sleep is more of an optional thing for me.
