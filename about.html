                <p>I'm Kenneth Doan, an aspiring Game Developer, Video Editor, and Local Funny Man. Video games have always had a special place in my heart. I've been playing video games for as long as I remember and one day I suddenly decided "Hey, what if I did that?" Since then, I've been designing all sorts of games. My goal is that one day, somebody out there will play my game and cherish the memory forever, just like games did for me.</p>

                ...Isn't this right below the "About Me" section? You would've already read-<br><br>
                You know what? Never mind.<br><br>

            <h4 class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(2)"><span id="answericon2">+</span> Q: Where did you learn to design games/edit videos?</h4>
            <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                Uhhhh... YouTube University? I'm mainly self-taught. I learned a long time ago the best way to learn to do something is to try, fail, repeat. So that's what I did. I'm currently studying game design now, but for the most part, everything I do is from years of screwing up and trying again.

            <h4 class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(3)"><span id="answericon3">+</span> Q: What types of games do you make</h4>
            <div class="answer" id="answer3">
                Well, a little bit of everything. I don't really specialize in one type of game. Instead, I think of something fun to try out. Maybe it's a mechanic from another game I wanted to expand on. Maybe a fusion between a bunch of different idea. I like building games around one fun mechanic and see how to best build around it.

            <div class="answer" id="answer4">
                I love creating things and entertaining people. Whether it be through a thrilling game or a funny video, I love making people laugh and have fun. <br><br>
                If you want to know why <em>specifically</em> video editing, I picked it up as a hobby one day it just stuck around.
